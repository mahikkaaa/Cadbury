create a method cadbury which takes 4 arguements - min_length, max_length, min_width, max_width
initialize another variable as count with value 0
start for loop with i value from min_length to max_length
add another nested loop with j value ranging from min_width to max_width
assign i to x and j to y
now we start while loop, when x and y are greater than 1 if x is greater than y, inncrement count and remove y from x else remove x from y and increment count
now outside while, if x and y are equal, then add 1 to count, since the peice cannot be broken further
if y=1 and x is not equal to 1 then add x to count else add y to count
exit both the loops ( for and while ) and return count
in main method prompt the user to add inputs for minimum and maximum length and width of the dimension of the cadbury
